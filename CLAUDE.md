# CLAUDE.md

The Ship: you are the AI of a sleeper ship and keep the crew alive by choosing who to wake and what to tell them.
C# / .NET 10, MonoGame DesktopGL, a local LLM through LLamaSharp (same stack and versions as the Cities repo).

**Read DESIGN.md first.** It is the leading design document: make design changes there. Keep this file's Progress section up to date:
add a line for every non-trivial change, and move items between "Built" and "Not built yet".

## Commands

```sh
dotnet build TheShip.slnx
dotnet test
dotnet run --project src/TheShip.Game -- [--seed <n>] [--llm <file.gguf>] [--gpu-layers <n>] [--no-llm]
```

- `--no-llm`, or no GGUF in `src/TheShip.Game/Content/Models/llm/`: templated crew lines and the keyword reader.
- Models: see the README.txt in that folder.

## Layout

| Project | What it holds |
| --- | --- |
| `src/TheShip.Core` | The simulation. No dependencies. Owns every state and outcome: crew, facts, statements, faults, time. |
| `src/TheShip.AI` | The language model: `ILlmProvider`, `LocalLlm` (LLamaSharp), `ScriptedLlm`, `LlmWorker`, GBNF grammars, prompts, `ShipMind`. |
| `src/TheShip.Game` | MonoGame window: a text UI with a typed input line. |
| `tests/TheShip.Tests` | xunit tests of the simulation and the reader. |

## Rules for the code

- The game owns the truth. The model writes crew lines and reads player lines; it never changes state.
  The one exception is the yes/no judgement of a free-text statement against evidence (DESIGN.md, "Reading").
- `TheShip.Core` must stay playable with no model: every crew line has a templated text, and `RuleReader` sorts player lines by keywords.
- Model calls go through `LlmWorker` (one at a time, most urgent first); results reach the simulation through `MainThreadQueue`.
- Structured model output is forced with a GBNF grammar, and every string in a grammar is bounded.
- Numbers that tune the game live in `Tuning.cs`.

## Progress

Scope of the first build is the prototype in DESIGN.md ("Prototype and open questions"): Short haul, text only,
6 crew, 60 years, 5 scripted alerts.

### Status

- 2026-11-12: repository scaffolded (solution, projects, font, design copy). Written in a cloud session with no .NET SDK:
  **nothing has been compiled or run yet.** The first job in a session that has `dotnet` is `dotnet build TheShip.slnx`,
  then `dotnet test`, and fixing whatever they report.
- 2026-11-12: DESIGN.md gained a "Run variation" section under "Gameplay variations" (what the seed varies per run).
  Design only; outside the prototype scope.
- 2026-11-12: DESIGN.md is now the leading design document. The earlier claude.ai document is no longer the source.

### Built

(nothing yet)

### Not built yet

Everything the design lists outside the prototype scope.
